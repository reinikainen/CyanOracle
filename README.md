# CyanOracle
This is an AI tool to explore the Cyanotypes Creative Agency Circle content and to custom build educational pathways to meet learner goals. More information about the Cyanotypes projects is here https://cyanotypes.website/ 

## How do I use this tool?

The easiest way to try the tool out is to use one of the example instances listed here. Always be careful of the accuracy of the output. Changes in the LLM models that happen behind the scenes can cause the tool to start hallucinating quite wildly, we have seen this happen.  

Example instances:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet - https://claude.ai/project/3f78cfb5-9d4d-476f-b6ec-00789bc69ac2 
ChatGPT - https://chatgpt.com/g/g-eo4keBsHH-cyanoracle 
Argo - Available for Cyanotypes partners in the Argo Cyanotypes Workspace

You can also recreate this tool using your preferred cloud based AI platform (e.g ChatGPT, Mistral, Claude, POE) or even run it locally on your own hardware if you know how to do that. All the necessary files, prompts and configuration parameters are included in this repository.

## Who is this tool for?

This tool is primarily for partners of the the Cyanotypes consortium but we are looking to widen the user base and use cases for the tool. Other users we are thinking of are:
 - Cyanotypes stakeholders who wish to explore the creative agency circle
 - Educational content designers who are building the next generation of courses for the creative industries
 - Higher education and VET institutions who are interested in offering their students more customised learning experiences
 - Learners who want to create a custom curriculum that meets their specific needs

## How do I recreate this tool myself?

## Can I contribute?

Yes! We are on a learning journey ourselves so any feedback or contributions are welcome. We particularly welcome ideas about how to refine the prompt and also how to best structure the data in the knowledge base for a more accurate and performant RAG pipeline.
